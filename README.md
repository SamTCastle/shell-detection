This project is part of research conducted in a 2015 REU Program
hosted by the Cerro-Tololo Inter-American Observatory and funded by the NSF.

---------- Doc format -----------
This document describes scripts used detect shells in shell galaxies.
The file name, path, usage, and any additional notes are given for every
script.
A description of the test data is also included.

---------- Python reqs ----------
** Many of these scripts use the Python libraries numpy, scipy, OpenCV (cv2),
astropy.io, and matplotlib, as well as the fileinput module.

---------- .fits files ----------
** Unless scripts explicitly require fits-proc.py, they generally only support
image formats, such as .png, recognized by the OpenCV library functions.
It is not difficult to adapt a script to also work with .fits files.
To do so, see an example file, such as
/shell-detection/contour-fitting/contours.py
or
/shell-detection/fmfed/main.py
or
/shell-detection/convolutions/std-kernel/convolution-plot.py

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test data

notes: Test data were made by varying 3 factors:
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), shape, and the amount of Gaussian blur.
Data are sorted in folders by shape and then in subfolders by
the size of the Gaussian blur kernel in pixels (a larger kernel means more
blurring).
Files are named according to the SNR of the image.
Poisson noise was added to every test image using a custom python script
described later in this document.

The process for creating the test data was as follows:
1. Draw desired shapes using GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP).
2. Color shapes based on desired SNR.
3. Blur via Gaussian convolution, built into GIMP.
4. Add Poisson noise with the python script apply-poisson-noise.py

Python scripts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python scripts are organized in the shell-detection folder.
They are presented here in order of their subfolder.
All file paths are:
/shell-detection/<subfolder>/<script-name>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
subfolder: add-noise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
overview: This collection of scripts was used to add Poisson noise to test data.

name: apply-poisson-noise.py
usage: python apply-poisson-noise.py <input_files>

notes: Adds Poisson noise to the input file.
An early attempt at a different implementation than the previous script.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
subfolder: coherence-elliptical-kernel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
overview: These files implement the explicit coherence enhancing filter with
spatial adaptive elliptical kernel from F. Li et al. 2012.

name: main.py
usage: python main.py
dependencies: none

the sourcecode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
subfolder: fft
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
overview: Scripts for using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) function in numpy.
In this implementation, images are converted to frequency space using the FFT.
Then, the high-frequency domain is truncated off the image, and the image
is reconverted using the inverse FFT.
In this way, the algorithm acts as a low-pass filter.
This removes high-frequency features such as edges sharper than those we
are attempting to detect, such as the sharp edges around stars.

name: main.py
usage: python main.py <input_files>
dependencies: fft-write-image.py
notes: Reads in a sequence of file paths of arbitrary length and calls
fft-write-image.py on each file.

usage: none
dependencies: none
notes: Called by main.py. This is the bulk of the algorithm.

name: fft-plot.py
usage: python fft-plot.py

overview: Both subsubfolders contain skeleton code for creating convolution
kernels from scratch.
Because of the convenient convolution functions in the OpenCV library,
these scripts were not required or used extensively in this research project.
Thus, they are not fully developed and need not be fully explained in this
document.
They are interesting for study, and the subfolder includes a set of files
written in C++ as well as a set written in Python.
